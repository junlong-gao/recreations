 * Hard (34.87%)
 * Total Accepted:    3.7K
 * Total Submissions: 10.6K
 * Testcase Example:  '["with","example","science"]\n"thehat"'
 *
 * 
 * We are given N different types of stickers.  Each sticker has a lowercase
 * English word on it.
 * 
 * You would like to spell out the given target string by cutting individual
 * letters from your collection of stickers and rearranging them.
 * 
 * You can use each sticker more than once if you want, and you have infinite
 * quantities of each sticker.
 * 
 * What is the minimum number of stickers that you need to spell out the
 * target?  If the task is impossible, return -1.
 * 
 * 
 * Example 1:
 * Input:
 * ["with", "example", "science"], "thehat"
 * 
 * 
 * Output:
 * 3
 * 
 * 
 * Explanation:
 * We can use 2 "with" stickers, and 1 "example" sticker.
 * After cutting and rearrange the letters of those stickers, we can form the
 * target "thehat".
 * Also, this is the minimum number of stickers necessary to form the target
 * string.
 * 
 * 
 * Example 2:
 * Input:
 * ["notice", "possible"], "basicbasic"
 * 
 * 
 * Output:
 * -1
 * 
 * 
 * Explanation:
 * We can't form the target "basicbasic" from cutting letters from the given
 * stickers.
 * 
 * 
 * Note:
 * stickers has length in the range [1, 50].
 * stickers consists of lowercase English words (without apostrophes).
 * target has length in the range [1, 15], and consists of lowercase English
 * letters.
 * In all test cases, all words were chosen randomly from the 1000 most common
 * US English words, and the target was chosen as a concatenation of two random
 * words.
 * The time limit may be more challenging than usual.  It is expected that a 50
 * sticker test case can be solved within 35ms on average.
 * 
 * Digestion:
 * This is another brute force. The trick is to use dp to remember visited nodes
 * and use special ordering.
 *
 * Why special ordering? The solution we search for is permutation symmetric.
 * This is in general true when we search for a fessible set (set does not have
 * ordering). To reduce search space (avoid discovering same set with different
 * permutation), we enforce ordering when we pick next element into our constructed
 * solution set.
 *
 * Special ordering:
 * [https://leetcode.com/problems/stickers-to-spell-word/discuss/108318/C%2B%2BJavaPython-DP-%2B-Memoization-with-optimization-29-ms-(C%2B%2B)]
 * >>>
 * Optimization: If the target can be spelled out by a group of stickers, at
 * least one of them has to contain character target[0]. So I explicitly
 * require next sticker containing target[0], which significantly reduced the
 * search space.
