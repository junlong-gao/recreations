/*
adding one edge will result in existing two nodes u and v such that path from u
to v is not unique.


if we don't have a node with 2 indegree, there must be a cycle (so every pair
of nodes have non-unique path). this is easy and we can remove any edge we
found on the cycle.

if we have a node having 2 indegree, we cannot delete either one of the edges
to make sure paths between all pair of nodes are unique:

1                 1 ---
|                 |    |
v                 v    v
2 <-> 3           2 -->3
for the left we must delete {3, 2}, for the right we can delete either {2, 3}
or {1, 3}

the trick is we try to delete the second edge of the found 2de edges first.
for the left case:
1                   1 --> 0
|
v
2 -> 3 -> 0         2 <-> 3
depending on which of the edges {1, 2} and {3, 2} we see first in the input.

for the right case:

      1 ---           1 ---> 0
      |    |          |
      v    v          v
0 <-- 2    3          2 ---> 3
depending on which of the edges {2, 3} and {1, 3} we see first in the input.


now if we find that after deleting one of the edges in 2de, we can still
find a non-unique path (right graph), then we automatically conclude we
have deleted the wrong edge and we should delete the undeleted one.

if we find all paths between two nodes are unique, then it is the deleted
edge caused the non-unique path.
