This report deals with the long intriguing problem of finding a curve such that the motion
along the curve in gravitational field has a fixed period regardless of its initial position. We
begin by reintroducing pendulum mechanics and analyzing how the initial position determines 
the period. Inspired by the old relation of harmonic motion, we are asking whether there is
a necessary and sufficient condition where the period is independent of initial positions. Finally,
we managed to solve the condition to obtain a cycloid. Based on the involute property of cycloids,
a tautochronous pendulum is constructed. This report concludes with another interesting story 
involving cycloids.
