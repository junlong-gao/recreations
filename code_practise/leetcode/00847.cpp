/*

Inspired by the tsp problem, considering state:
(currentCities, pos)
where currentCities is a set of cities on the current path, pos is the last of
the cities visited.

We cannot use a dp solution in tsp as we can visit same city multiple times.
Also, there is no trivial recursive solution for deriving a solution for
(currentCities, pos)
from its smaller instance, as you can easily run into cycles since you can visit
a city multiple times:
({1, 2, 0}, 0) -> ({1, 0, 2}, 2) -> ({1, 2, 0}, 0)
if city 0 and 2 are connected,

however, we know the starting states:
({i}, i)
and the finishing states
({0, 1, â€¦ n - 1), i)
and the edges between the states:
(cur, i) -> (cur \union {j}, j) if and only if there is a path between cities i and j
and most importantly, we know a particular optimial path corresponds to a
simple path in this state space (if a path corresponds to a path in the state space with
cycle, then there exists two nodes having same set of cities and end point, so we
can just remove the portion of the nodes visited in the cycle from the path to
get a better solution).
Then we can find a shortest path between any source states and
target states, since a path length represents a cost for a particular path
from some starting city to some end city.

instead of deriving a recursive solution for the original problem, we can simply
run bfs over the derived graph to find a shortest path, and then it is our
solution.
